This is a small ftplugin that helps jumping to a key in a bibtex file. 
It assumes a bibtex file that is alphabethically ordered by the bibitem 
key. Maybe some people will find this useful.

Type <LocalLeader>g and a bibtex-key you want to find.
Type <LocalLeader>n to jump to the next key in line.

Example use:

If the keys in the file were: 
    
    @article{aa,
    ...}
    @article{ab
    ...}
    @article{aba
    ...}
    @article{ac
    ...}

then '<LL>gab<cr>' would take you to "ab" but '<LL>nab<cr>' to "ac". 
Actually BibGotoNextIndex is the main reason for why I wrote this one.

If g:bibFindIndexAllowSpaces is true, the "entry head" may include whitespace. 
(I'm not sure if this is legal bibtex, though.)
